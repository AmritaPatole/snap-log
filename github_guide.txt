Follow below steps to add your work to snap-log repository in github

1. Create a fork of AmritaPatole/snap-log on the github website (You need to do this only once)
    example: https://github.com/<your github-id>/snap-log
    Create and add your SSH key to github: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/

2. Checkout a new tree
    It is preferable to have your tree in /local instead of /home.
    /home is backed up and is found to be slower.
    Create your workspace:

3. mkdir -p /local/<user-name>/<ws-name>/

4. cd /local/<user-name>/<ws-name>

5. git clone git@github.com:AmritaPatole/snap-log

6. Adding git remote (this needs to be done whenever ‘git clone <>’ is done)
    git remote add <your-tag> <your-github-fork>
    <your-tag> is used later for pushing commits
    <your-girthub-fork> is the fork made on your github account
    For e.g. :  https://github.com/kalyanbade/sw

7. git remote add upstream git@github.com:AmritaPatole/snap-log

8. git pull -r upstream main

9. git checkout -b <your-branch-name>

10. Start making your changes here and commit locally.

11. git push <your-tag> <your-branch-name>
